              Kanga or softball cricket is the ideal way to introduce your child
              to the basic skills of cricket. The modified program works on the
              effective method of introducing and practicing a skill then
              following it with a game. This method has proved both a learning
              and enjoyable environment for all our budding young cricketers in
              both our junior program and our summer camps. The program also
              offers regulation hardball cricket geared towards those who
              possess past experience in the game. The rotational program will
              see participants take part in a number of cricket sessions under
              the guidance of professional coaches and players. Training
              sessions, including batting and bowling provide a great
              opportunity to learn and improve and modified games are regular
              features. Cricket can be played by both boys and girls and we
              welcome kids of all abilities and skills levels.
